## Digital Millenium Copyright Act

### Filing a Notification

A written notification must be made. This can be done by written email to the owner. Letters or faxes will not be accepted unless a prior arrangement has been made. The notification must:

1. Identify in sufficient detail the copyrighted work that you believe has been infringed upon *(i.e., describe the work that you own)*.
2. Identify the item that you claim is infringing on your copyright, and provide information reasonably sufficient to locate the item. For example "The allegedly infringing work I am referring to is located at the URL ..."
3. Provide a reasonably sufficient method of contacting you; phone number and email address would be preferred along with verifiable mailing address.
4. *(Optional)* Provide information, if possible, sufficient to permit identification of the content that allegedly contains infringing material. You may also provide screenshots or other materials that are helpful to identify the works in question. *(This is for identification only, not to "prove" substantive claims.)*
5. Include the following statement: "I have good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials described above and contained on the service is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or by protection of law."
6. Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."
7. Digitally sign the email.

Please note: The DMCA provides that you may be liable for damages *(including costs and attorneys fees)* if you falsely claim that an item is infringing your copyrights. We recommend contacting an attorney if you are unsure whether an item is protected by copyright laws.
