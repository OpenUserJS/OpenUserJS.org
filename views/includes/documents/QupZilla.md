## QupZilla

QupZilla is a new and very fast Qt browser. It is actively developed and uses open standards (so it's easier for programmers to work with it). It aims to be a lightweight web browser available through all major platforms.

This project has been originally started only for educational purposes. But from its start, QupZilla has grown into a feature-rich browser. The very first version of QupZilla has been released in December 2010 and it was written in Python with PyQt4 bindings. After a few versions, QupZilla has been completely rewritten in C++ with the Qt Framework.

QupZilla ships with its own port of Greasemonkey as an extension.
