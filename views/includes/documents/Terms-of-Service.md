## Terms of Service

### Etiquette
* Everyone should maintain a professional and civil demeanor towards each other.
* Staying on topic is a good thing to remember. Everyone has other duties to attend to at different times. Try to be succinct and don't obsess on a particular topic. Give others a chance to respond.
* Intense conversations regarding "filling voids" should be avoided. Advocacy of one site or another should be minimal and gracefully done.
* Passive aggressive behavior with abrasive commenting does not encourage teamwork even when it is coupled with genuine constructive feedback. Personal attacks may be eligible for account removal from OpenUserJS.org.
* **"Open Source" is not the same as "the developers must do my bidding"**. A lot of generous time is donated by multiple developers in attempting to resolve any properly presented issues. However this does not mean there is an obligation to do it on any single persons time table. Until the OpenUserJS.org bills are paid by everyone involved it's a wise choice to be courteous instead of snarky.

### Abstraction

#### Obfuscation

Obfuscation is currently prohibited.

#### Minification

Within moderation we understand the occasional necessity to conserve device storage space. This is currently under discussion in development.

### Target Site Abuse

* If it is determined that a script is intentionally abusive towards any target site it will be removed and the account may be barred. This includes, but not limited to, cookie stealing scripts.
* Spamming is currently prohibited. Some minor exceptions may be allowed if it is found to be in context of a particular topic and related to User Scripts.
* Posting script source snippets in a discussion should be properly formatted with markdown code fences, markdown code, markup pre tags,  and/or markup code tags with appropriate discussion. e.g. **Do not** post only script source without explaining what it means in human terms. If this is not followed both the comment and the account is, again, eligible for removal.

### Recommendations

* Fully describe a published script as this will help others know exactly what is being offered. Vague scripts are not recommended.
* Utilize the peer review system. It is there for the benefit of everyone.
* Have fun but at the same time not at some other persons expense.

### Licensing

#### Reserved Rights

* OpenUserJs.org reserves including but not limited to the implied right to publish, distribute, and terminate access to your published works and code snippets to maintain the integrity of OpenUserJS.org.
* OpenUserJs.org allows all published works on OpenUserJS.org to be forked via OpenUserJS.org forking capabilities.

#### Default Code Licensing

* User Scripts have an implied license of [MIT License (Expat)][osiMITLicenseExpat] if the `@license` *(including the alternate spelling of `@licence`)* metadata block key is absent.
* Library Scripts need to include one reference to their [acceptable license(s)][oujsAcceptableLicensing] either via a License Header *([sample MPL header][mozMPLHeaders] if that license is chosen)*, a cross-site compatible metadata block with at least one `@license` or `@licence` key **and** one `@exclude *`, or full License text *(full text is not recommended for storage constraints on portable devices)*. Libraries also have an implied license of [MIT License (Expat)][osiMITLicenseExpat] in the absence of any licensing *(however this should not happen)*. It may also be useful to indicate in the source that it is a library and not a userscript. If the type of script is unclear the library may be subject to removal.

#### Acceptable Licensing
* Licensing must be [Open Source Initiative *(OSI)* approved][osiApprovedLicenses] and declared with the name of the License in the Source Code for all published works. e.g. `@license` or `@licence` keys, License Header or full License text *(full text is not recommended for storage constraints on portable devices)*
* If a Content only license is included then the [Default Code Licensing][oujsDefaultCodeLicensing] will be applied with licensing arbitration, but may not always be visibly indicated on a script home page.
* Any license that prohibits derivatives is eligible for removal.
* Non-reusable licenses, of course, may not be used.
* [Public domain type][osiPublicDomain] licenses may mean different things in different jurisdictions and therefore are not allowed and eligible for removal.
* Any attempt to unlicense a published work will be eligible for removal.
* In the event of any code licensing dispute resolution the [Default Code Licensing][oujsDefaultCodeLicensing] shall prevail if previously undeclared and/or undocumented.

### The Fine Print

If you are obligated to indemnify us, we will have the right, in our sole and unfettered discretion, to control any action or proceeding and determine whether we wish to settle it, and if so, on what terms.
