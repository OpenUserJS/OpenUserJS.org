## Chrome

Chrome is a free web browser developed by Google. Most of its code draws from the open-source [Chromium][] project. Chrome's selling points are security, speed, simplicity and stability. The desktop version runs on Windows, Linux and OS X, and there are mobile versions for Android and iOS.

To run userscripts on Chrome, you normally need a manager extension such as Tampermonkey.
